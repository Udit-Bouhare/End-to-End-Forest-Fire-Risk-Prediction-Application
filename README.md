# Algerian Forest Fire – FWI Prediction

This project predicts the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** using the Algerian Forest Fire dataset.

It is an end-to-end Machine Learning project that includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Saving the trained model
- Flask-based web application
- HTML UI for user input

Users can enter environmental features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc., and the model returns the predicted **FWI value**, which indicates forest fire risk.
