# 🔥 Algerian Forest Fire – FWI Prediction

This project predicts the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** using the Algerian Forest Fire dataset.  
It is an **end-to-end Machine Learning application** built with a complete workflow from data processing to deployment.

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Trained model saved using pickle  
- Flask API for backend prediction  
- Simple HTML UI for user input  
- Predicts FWI value indicating forest fire risk

## 🔧 Input Features
Users can enter environmental conditions such as:
- Temperature  
- Relative humidity  
- Wind speed  
- Rain  
- Other weather parameters  

The model returns a **predicted FWI value**, helping indicate potential fire risk.

## 🎯 Project Purpose
To demonstrate an end-to-end ML workflow:
- Data → Model → API → Web App → Deployment  
Ideal for learning, portfolio building, and showcasing ML deployment skills.
